# Networking

### Different Network Types and Standards
#### Peer-based
Peer-based, Peer-to-peer or P2P networks mainly revolve around having two or more PCs connected and sharing the resources without utilising a separate server computer. Peer-to-peer networks allows each node to function as both the client and the server, unlike the client-server where the client makes the request and the server has to fulfil it.

Computers running P2P networks generally run the same protocols and software. Peer network devices generally sit close to one another, much like a row of computers in an office, but some can be spread worldwide via the internet. These networks can provide anonymized routing of network traffic, provide parallel computing environments across computers, allow distributed storage and other functions.
Different P2P applications can allow for control parameters, such as how many connections be allowed at one time, what systems can be connected to or avoided, what services can be offered and how many resources can be devoted to the network.

P2P networks are easy to understand and set up. Any computer can be used and a simple hub or switch can be used to connect it all together and because of this, there is no need for any special hardware or software; there is no need for any servers and each computer can be managed by the individual users. All computers can be maintained, meaning no need for any network manager and that there is less network traffic because of the fact that no one in the peered network needs to rely on a single server.

However, because of the way that Peer-to-peer works, there can be some drawbacks. Each computer fulfils more than one role, be it printing or file sharing and can increase the load. As the computers have to be maintained themselves, every user must ensure that antivirus and malware protection software are installed on each computer retrospectively, otherwise should a virus infect one machine, it will quickly be transferred across any other computer connected to this network.

#### Client-server
Client network is a model that involves a client and a server, where the client requests a service from the server.

#### Cloud
#### Cluster
#### Centralised
#### Virtualised
