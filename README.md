### Different Network Types and Standards
#### Peer-based
Peer-based, Peer-to-peer or P2P networks mainly revolve around having two or more PCs connected and sharing the resources without utilising a separate server computer. Peer-to-peer networks allows each node to function as both the client and the server, unlike the client-server where the client makes the request and the server has to fulfil it.

Computers running P2P networks generally run the same protocols and software. Peer network devices generally sit close to one another, much like a row of computers in an office, but some can be spread worldwide via the internet. These networks can provide anonymized routing of network traffic, provide parallel computing environments across computers, allow distributed storage and other functions.
Different P2P applications can allow for control parameters, such as how many connections be allowed at one time, what systems can be connected to or avoided, what services can be offered and how many resources can be devoted to the network.

P2P networks are easy to understand and set up. Any computer can be used and a simple hub or switch can be used to connect it all together and because of this, there is no need for any special hardware or software; there is no need for any servers and each computer can be managed by the individual users. All computers can be maintained, meaning no need for any network manager and that there is less network traffic because of the fact that no one in the peered network needs to rely on a single server.

However, because of the way that Peer-to-peer works, there can be some drawbacks. Each computer fulfils more than one role, be it printing or file sharing and can increase the load. As the computers have to be maintained themselves, every user must ensure that antivirus and malware protection software are installed on each computer retrospectively, otherwise should a virus infect one machine, it will quickly be transferred across any other computer connected to this network.

#### Client-server
Client network is a model that involves a client and a server, where the client requests a service from the server. The request that the client makes is to connect to a website over a local area network, to which a secure connection to the server. The connection is then terminated once the server has fulfilled the client’s request. Internet browsers are basically a client program that when clicked on a link to a web page, has actually requested a service from the server.

All resources and data are controlled by the server so that a program or an unauthorized client can’t damage the system, which better facilitates the task of uploading data and other such resources. Also noting that because of the centralization, backups and security is handled by the server, without the user having to do it themselves. Roles can be distributed to several computers and that servers can be replaced or fixed without any of the users being interrupted.

There can be some drawbacks to this network model; the server, for one, is expensive to purchase and install, along with requiring professional IT specialists to handle the maintenance and technical details of the network. Unlike the P2P server, congestion may be likely to happen if the server takes in too many requests, leading to overload of servers.

#### Cloud
Cloud network or cloud based networking is a network model that uses a third party provider for accessing resources via Wide Area Networking. Cloud networking uses cloud computing, where centralized computing resources are shared amongst clients, but the network is also shared as well. It works the same way as standard networking but it’s component, devices and operations are all in the cloud.

The main benefit of cloud computing is that you can connect anywhere at any time regardless of device or place. A user can connect via a router that goes directly to the cloud server, so the user is not bound to a room. Cloud networking shares its characteristics with cloud computing, meaning that the benefits of cloud computing are also present with networking. For instance, you can access, edit and share documents at any time with people who are also connected to the network, allowing for good teamwork workflow without having to be in the same office.

#### Cluster
A computer cluster consists of a single unit made up of multiple computers linked through a LAN and the joint computers act as if they were a single powerful machine. They have a node set to each cluster to perform the same task, so that they can perform that task at a faster rate with a higher joint processing speed.

The obvious benefit that Cluster networking offers is the processing speed, where the computers working together provide unified processing, producing the fastest amount overall. If a single component in the cluster fails, other computers can continue to provide the processing, backing up the failed component. The computer cluster is made up of different LAN topologies and these networks create a highly efficient and effective mainframe that prevents any bottlenecking.
